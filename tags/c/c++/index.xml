      <description>Continuing where we left off last week, let&amp;rsquo;s finally dicuss the optimal solution to the Set Matrix Zeroes problem from LeetCode. If you have not read Part 1, please do so! In the previous post, we discussed the problem &amp;amp; constraints, as well as some intuition behind the solution. Building off of this intuition, let&amp;rsquo;s go over the algorithm!
The Solution Recalling our constant-space requirement, and the conflicts that can come from writing zeroes before completing the first read, how can we safely indicate which rows and columns will be set to zero without compromising correctness?</description>

      <description>This problem, of medium difficulty, sounds trivial at first glance. However, given the constraints, it&amp;rsquo;s not as straightforward as it initially appears.
The Problem The problems is set-up as seen here: Set Matrix Zeroes - LeetCode
 Given an m x n integer matrix matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0&amp;rsquo;s, and return the matrix.
You must do it in place.
Constraints:
 m == matrix.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re already developing a C/C++ project in VS Code, configuring the built-in debugger will allow you to fully use features already within the IDE with only a single configuration file. To those are used to debugging in IDEs like IntelliJ or Visual Studio, this is a much more familiar and pleasant experience. Additionally, this can be done both locally and over SSH via the Remote - SSH extension.
For Computer Science &amp;amp; Engineering courses at the UW, I typically open the folder containing my entire repo in VS Code (i.</description>
