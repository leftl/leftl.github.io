      <title>An Introduction to GraphQL</title>

      <description>GraphQL is a query language developed by Facebook; It has become popular for retrieving data over HTTP from various backends/databases under a single API (or even databases directly). That is, data is accessible from potentially different sources under a single query language. There are libraries, for both server and client functions, in many languages, including Java, Python, C/C++, JavaScript, etc.
Why GraphQL? The main advantage of GraphQL is the ability for the client to decide what information is returned by a single query.</description>

      <title>LeetCode: Number of Islands</title>

      <description>For the second entry in the LeetCode series, I will be discussing another medium-difficulty problem. However, unlike the in-depth analysis covered in the last LeetCode problem, this post will be a succinct overview of an efficient solution. This problem is great because it&amp;rsquo;s easily to visualize the input, and it does not have a lot of constraints. It also never hurts to have more practice with multidimensional arrays + graph searching algorithms.</description>

      <title>Leetcode: Set Matrix Zeroes (Part 2)</title>

      <description>Continuing where we left off last week, let&amp;rsquo;s finally dicuss the optimal solution to the Set Matrix Zeroes problem from LeetCode. If you have not read Part 1, please do so! In the previous post, we discussed the problem &amp;amp; constraints, as well as some intuition behind the solution. Building off of this intuition, let&amp;rsquo;s go over the algorithm!
The Solution Recalling our constant-space requirement, and the conflicts that can come from writing zeroes before completing the first read, how can we safely indicate which rows and columns will be set to zero without compromising correctness?</description>

      <description>This problem, of medium difficulty, sounds trivial at first glance. However, given the constraints, it&amp;rsquo;s not as straightforward as it initially appears.
The Problem The problems is set-up as seen here: Set Matrix Zeroes - LeetCode
 Given an m x n integer matrix matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0&amp;rsquo;s, and return the matrix.
You must do it in place.
Constraints:
 m == matrix.</description>

      <title>Open-Source Highlight: Jellyfin</title>

      <description>Open-source projects are plentiful, so I decided to highlight a few standouts which deserve some extra love. Well&amp;hellip; all of them deserve extra love, but I&amp;rsquo;d like to highlight a few of my (100% biased) favorites. First up is a self-hosted media server I&amp;rsquo;ve had the pleasure of using for several years, now &amp;ndash; Jellyfin.
What is Jellyfin Jellyfin allows you to host the TV Series/Films/Music you own on a single server, and access this media from any device either through a web browser or client.</description>

      <title>Visual Debugging on VS Code Using GDB</title>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re already developing a C/C++ project in VS Code, configuring the built-in debugger will allow you to fully use features already within the IDE with only a single configuration file. To those are used to debugging in IDEs like IntelliJ or Visual Studio, this is a much more familiar and pleasant experience. Additionally, this can be done both locally and over SSH via the Remote - SSH extension.
For Computer Science &amp;amp; Engineering courses at the UW, I typically open the folder containing my entire repo in VS Code (i.</description>
