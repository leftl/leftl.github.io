      <title>Containerizing a Simple Node Application with Docker</title>

      <description>Containers, which may be well past their prime as the &amp;ldquo;hottest new technology&amp;rdquo;, still have a strong use case in the development and delivery of software.
A container wraps up all of the software needed to run an application into a single &amp;ldquo;runtime&amp;rdquo;. This includes the application itself, and all of the dependencies wrapped up in a developer-defined environment. Any given container will run the same on all hardware and operating systems, as long as the container platform is installed.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to GraphQL</title>

      <description>GraphQL is a query language developed by Facebook; It has become popular for retrieving data over HTTP from various backends/databases under a single API (or even databases directly). That is, data is accessible from potentially different sources under a single query language. There are libraries, for both server and client functions, in many languages, including Java, Python, C/C++, JavaScript, etc.
Why GraphQL? The main advantage of GraphQL is the ability for the client to decide what information is returned by a single query.</description>

      <title>LeetCode: Number of Islands</title>

      <description>For the second entry in the LeetCode series, I will be discussing another medium-difficulty problem. However, unlike the in-depth analysis covered in the last LeetCode problem, this post will be a succinct overview of an efficient solution. This problem is great because it&amp;rsquo;s easily to visualize the input, and it does not have a lot of constraints. It also never hurts to have more practice with multidimensional arrays + graph searching algorithms.</description>

      <title>Obsibian: Smart Plaintext Notes</title>

      <description>Obsibian: Smart Plaintext Notes Obsidian is a modern cross-platform note-taking application. By adapting my note-taking habits to fit the strengths of Obsidian, my notes have become more meaningful in content and reviewability. Those familiar with Notion and similar note-taking applications will feel right at home, but what makes Obsidian different?
Features: Backlinking The star of the show: linking notes to build connections. It sounds pretty inconsequential, but it is great for helping structure your notes in more meaningful ways improving the value of your notes.</description>

      <title>Leetcode: Set Matrix Zeroes (Part 2)</title>
      <link>https://twtrs.com/2021/11/leetcode-set-matrix-zeroes-part-2/</link>

      <description>Continuing where we left off last week, let&amp;rsquo;s finally dicuss the optimal solution to the Set Matrix Zeroes problem from LeetCode. If you have not read Part 1, please do so! In the previous post, we discussed the problem &amp;amp; constraints, as well as some intuition behind the solution. Building off of this intuition, let&amp;rsquo;s go over the algorithm!
The Solution Recalling our constant-space requirement, and the conflicts that can come from writing zeroes before completing the first read, how can we safely indicate which rows and columns will be set to zero without compromising correctness?</description>

      <description>This problem, of medium difficulty, sounds trivial at first glance. However, given the constraints, it&amp;rsquo;s not as straightforward as it initially appears.
The Problem The problems is set-up as seen here: Set Matrix Zeroes - LeetCode
Given an m x n integer matrix matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0&amp;rsquo;s, and return the matrix.
You must do it in place.
Constraints:
m == matrix.</description>

      <title>Open-Source Highlight: Jellyfin</title>

      <description>Open-source projects are plentiful, so I decided to highlight a few standouts which deserve some extra love. Well&amp;hellip; all of them deserve extra love, but I&amp;rsquo;d like to highlight a few of my (100% biased) favorites. First up is a self-hosted media server I&amp;rsquo;ve had the pleasure of using for several years, now &amp;ndash; Jellyfin.
What is Jellyfin Jellyfin allows you to host the TV Series/Films/Music you own on a single server, and access this media from any device either through a web browser or client.</description>
