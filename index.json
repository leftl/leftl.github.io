[{"content":"This problem, of medium difficulty, sounds trivial at first glance. However, given the constraints, it\u0026rsquo;s not as straightforward as it initially appears.\nThe Problem The problems is set-up as seen here: Set Matrix Zeroes - LeetCode\n Given an m x n integer matrix matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0\u0026rsquo;s, and return the matrix.\nYou must do it in place.\nConstraints:\n m == matrix.length n == matrix[0].length 1 \u0026lt;= m, n \u0026lt;= 200 2^31 \u0026lt;= matrix[i][j] \u0026lt;= 2^31 - 1   We will be discussing the optimal solution, which has an additional constraint: space must be O(1), also known as constant-space. This means we cannot create a copy of the matrix or use any other data structures which depend on m and/or n (e.g. arrays, lists, maps).\nThe following image depicts the expected output of the algorithm, following the order input -\u0026gt; output. We can see the only 0 in the input on the input is in the intersection of the third row from the top (index: 2) and the 2nd column from the left (index: 1). We will represent this position as the tuple, (2,1).\nBy the constraints given, we can note the input cannot be empty (furthermore, it must be at least 1 x 0. That is, one row and zero columns, per a row-major representation). We can also see that each element in the matrix is a typical signed 4-byte integer. While there is no constraint on the run-time of this algorithm, it is given that the algorithm must modify the matrix in place. Additionally, with the constant-space requirement, we cannot make a copy of the matrix to preserve all values in the original matrix.\nConsiderations The fact that we modify the only \u0026ldquo;source of truth,\u0026rdquo; means we must tread carefully as we build output. Your first intuition may be to simply traverse the matrix, and set columns and rows to zero as a 0 element is encountered. However, if we modify the input before finding all positions, we may read a \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; 0 element which is a 1 in the input. We will illustrate this concern in the diagram below:\nIf we modify the matrix during the first iteration, it is possible to modify elements not yet visited. In the matrix labeled C, the next element at (0,1) is now 0, per applying the set-zero rule on the index (0,0). However, the algorithm will now apply the set-zeros rule to the index (0,1) as seen in matrix D. Recall from the input, A, that there was no 0 element on the second column or the second row. The resulting matrix is not correct, even though the expected output is the intermediary matrix, B.\nIntuition To avoid the issue described above, we must complete the first read before modifying the input. This requires creating some record(s) of the rows and columns to be overwritten with zeros. However, keeping in mind the constant-space requirement, this record must be contained inside the matrix itself and/or some constant number of variables (i.e. not bound by m or n). No additional data structures can be created.\nSome hints to help reach the solution:\n Is there a particular row/column which can be used to hold flags? Does this selection vary depending on if you iterate through the matrix by rows or columns? Are there special cases to applying the set-zero rule to this row/column holding the flags?  Wrapping-Up In part two we will complete the intuition, go over the algorithm (in C++), and discuss overall run-time/correctness. Try to build on some of the intuition shared in this post and find a solution of your own. Otherwise, catch the solution next week!\n","permalink":"https://twtrs.com/2021/11/leetcode-set-matrix-zeroes-part-1/","summary":"This problem, of medium difficulty, sounds trivial at first glance.

Well\u0026hellip; all of them deserve extra love, but I\u0026rsquo;d like to highlight a few of my (100% biased) favorites. First up is a self-hosted media server I\u0026rsquo;ve had the pleasure of using for several years, now \u0026ndash; Jellyfin.\nWhat is Jellyfin Jellyfin allows you to host the TV Series/Films/Music you own on a single server, and access this media from any device either through a web browser or client. It is essentially your own personal Netflix, handling some technical details behind the scenes (like automatically fetching metadata and ensuring media is compatible with all clients) so you can focus on just enjoying your media.\nThis project is based on Emby, forked from the last open-source release after Emby decided to change their licensing and go closed-source. The goal of Jellyfin is to provide the premier open-source media server experience, similar to Emby and Plex, but without requiring a paid license to access all features.\nRunning Jellyfin Depending on the hardware you wish to run Jellyfin on, the installation process will be different. Luckily, there is a guide available that can quickly get you going. If you prefer to follow along with a video, there are many tutorials available on YouTube, as well.\n Official Quick Start Guide  How to Contribute The greatest part of open source software is that you have the freedom to implement the features you want to see in the final product. Of course, not everyone is a developer, but anyone can contribute! From suggesting new features and reporting bugs, to creating art and translating the interface, everyone is free to contribute to the project! All source code is available on GitHub:\n Server - jellyfin/jellyfin Web Client (Official) - jellyfin/jellyfin-web Android TV - jellyfin/jellyfin-androidtv iOS/tvOS (Official) - jellyfin/Swiftfin  Additionally, you can read the contributors guide to get started. If you have never contributed to a project before, the Jellyfin team would love to help you with your first pull request (PR). Most of the official repos feature a good first issue label to help you get started with your first contribution. The team helped me with my first PR, and I can promise your time/effort will be appreciated, no matter how simple you believe your contribution maybe!\n","permalink":"https://twtrs.com/2021/10/open-source-highlight-jellyfin/","summary":"Open-source projects are plentiful, so I decided to highlight a few standouts which deserve some extra love.

To those are used to debugging in IDEs like IntelliJ or Visual Studio, this is a much more familiar and pleasant experience. Additionally, this can be done both locally and over SSH via the Remote - SSH extension.\nFor Computer Science \u0026amp; Engineering courses at the UW, I typically open the folder containing my entire repo in VS Code (i.e. ~/code/cse3xx-21au-username), which contains all of the course\u0026rsquo;s projects. This makes configuring debugging easier since you don\u0026rsquo;t have to copy this JSON file into every folder if you typically just open a project\u0026rsquo;s folder directly (i.e. ~/code/cse3xx-21au-username/hw1 ), as the configuration is expected to be found in a folder at the highest level with the current workspace.\nConfiguring Visual Debugging To open the default configuration file, click the Run and Debug icon (or Ctrl+Shift+d), then click the cog icon at the top of the sidebar that opens.

This configuration depends on the path of that open file to find the path of the test_suite executable. For example, if you want to debug the executable test_suite in a folder named hw1, you would simply have open a file within the directory containing that executable, such as ~/cse3xx-21au-username/hw1/LinkedList.c, before starting a debugging session.\nCreating breakpoints and adding a variable to the watchlist is similar other IDEs (see more: https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/debugging).\nYou can add more configs to target different executables, and edit the args field to append arguments just like you would on the command line.
